Developed a sophisticated RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline that enables secure, workspace-specific document search and contextual AI responses. The system features robust data isolation between workspaces, ensuring users can only access authorized content through custom embedding models and granular permission controls. Implemented efficient document chunking, embedding generation, and vector similarity search to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses while maintaining strict data compartmentalization.
